# Create and handon lab guide for first github actions yaml file with execution steps

Here‚Äôs a practical, step-by-step **hand-on lab guide** to create and execute your **first GitHub Actions workflow (YAML) file**:

## üèÅ Step 1: Create or Open a GitHub Repository

- Go to [github.com](https://github.com), log in, and create a new repository (or use an existing one).


## üìù Step 2: Add Your First GitHub Actions Workflow

### Using the GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to your repository main page.
2. Click the **Actions** tab.
3. Select ‚Äúset up a workflow yourself‚Äù (or choose the ‚ÄúSimple Workflow‚Äù).
4. This opens an editor to create a `.yml` file under `.github/workflows`.

### Locally via Git and IDE

1. Inside your repo, create a directory:

```
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

2. Inside `.github/workflows`, create a file, e.g. `first-action.yml`.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Step 3: Write a Simple Workflow (YAML Example)

Paste the following into `.github/workflows/first-action.yml`:

```yaml
name: First GitHub Actions Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  hello-world:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Print Hello, World
        run: echo "üéâ Hello, GitHub Actions!"
```


## üíæ Step 4: Commit and Push

- If you used the web UI, click **Start commit** or **Commit changes**.
- If local:

```sh
git add .github/workflows/first-action.yml
git commit -m "Add first GitHub Actions workflow"
git push
```


## üö¶ Step 5: Trigger and Observe Execution

1. Any push to the repository (including this commit) **automatically triggers the workflow**.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
3. You‚Äôll see a workflow run triggered by your commit.
4. Click on the workflow run to see ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù job, then expand steps to view log output‚Äîthe ‚ÄúPrint Hello, World‚Äù step should show your echo message.

## üßëüî¨ Step 6: Experiment

- Change the echo message, commit and push again‚Äîsee it trigger.
- Try adding another step, for example:

```yaml
- name: List files
  run: ls -l
```


## üìù What You Learned

- How to set up a workflow folder and YAML file.
- Workflow triggers (`on: [push]`), job setup, and basic steps.
- Checked results/logs in the Actions tab.

**You‚Äôve successfully built and run your first GitHub Actions pipeline!**
As next steps, try expanding the workflow: add test steps, deploy scripts, or use marketplace actions for more advanced automation.
